# Welcome to My E-Portfolio

My name is Tamar Ervin and I am a rising senior at the University of California,
Los Angeles originally from San Diego, CA. I am studying Astrophysics with a minor in Atmospheric and Oceanic 
Sciences. In addition to my academic studies, I am a member of UCLA's College Scholars
program, a Regents Scholar, and Big Bang Theory Scholar. I work as a Logistical Head Learning
Assistant in the Physics and Astronomy Department, am an officer in my sorority, and play for the UCLA Club
Field Hockey Team! I also work as a tutor for [Ignite Tutoring LA](https://www.ignitetutoringla.com/) where I specialize in Physics, Chemistry, 
and Calculus tutoring.

My [research](research.md) interests primarily lie in the realm of Solar physics, specifically 
how machine learning and data analysis tools can improve our understanding of the Sun and 
then apply this knowledge to other stellar systems. I am currently a Space Sciences and Exoplanet
Research Intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the mentorship of Dr. Samuel Halverson, where I am
working on improving the precision boundary of radial velocity measurements by building proxies for stellar 
activity.
