**UCLA Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department**  
*Independent Student Researcher, Advisor: Dr. Jacob Bortnik*   

- Developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm for coronal hole and active region detection.  
- Generated methods for comparison between unsupervised detection and previous detection methods.  

**Predictive Science Inc.**  
*Solar Physics Intern, Advisor: Dr. Cooper Downs*    

- Worked on Coronal Hole (CH) detection and modeling to build magnetic flux maps.  
- Built data driven methods to correct for limb-brightening and intensity variations among solar disk images.  
- Created an image processing to mapping pipeline producing synchronic and synoptic EUV and CH maps
along with full CR sun maps to generate CH probability maps for space weather forecasting.  
  
**UCLA Physics and Astronomy**  
*Logistical and Pedagogical Head Learning Assistant*    

- Lead twice weekly discussion and lab sections teaching students coding and circuitry skills.  
- Facilitate weekly seminars for other LAs discussing evidence based teaching techniques.  
- Assist course professor and TA in leading office hours, pre-exam review sessions, and with course logistics.  
  
**Ignite Tutoring Los Angeles**  
*Multi-Subject Tutor*  

- Multi-subject tutor specializing in math and sciences: Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Calculus.
