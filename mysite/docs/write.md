**Machine Learning Methods for Coronal Hole and Active Region Detection**  
*Atmospheric and Oceanics Sciences 199*  

The detection and mapping of Coronal Holes (CH) in solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-Ray
images is useful for a variety of scientific and space weather prediction applications.  We build upon a
previous pipeline for multi-spacecraft synchronic mapping and detection, where long-term averages
of EUVI/STEREO A/B (195 A) and SDO/AIA (193 A) images are used to compute data-derived
corrections for center-to-limb variations in images and intensity differences among instruments.  Full-
Sun maps are built using a merge-mapping process which favors lower intensity data in areas of overlap, 
helping to mitigate the systematic issues of obscuration and evolution.  After image processing and 
mapping, coronal holes and active regions are detected using both a supervised Convolutional Neural Network and K-Means clustering. 

**On the Creation of Tranquilty**  
*Musicology 68: The Beatles*  

An analysis of The Beatles song "Sun King" from the *Abbey Road* album released in September, 1969 with Fleetwood Mac's 
"Albatross" from their 1969 album *The Pious Bird of Good Omen*. I argue that through their choice of instrumentation, synthesization, 
and recording techniques, The Beatles enhanced the sound of "Albatross" and emulates the feeling of floating in the ocean
to preserve the ecstasy of the era.  


## Second Year

**Coronal mass ejections and their effect on the near-Earth environment**  
*Atmospheric and Oceanics Sciences C170/205A*  

My final paper for the concurrent enrollment course AOS-C170/205A: Introduction to Solar System Plasmas.
It discusses the basics behind our understanding of Coronal Mass Ejections, how they erupt, evolve through interplanetary space,
and have the potential to interact with other magnetized objects. This paper concludes with a discussion of the effects
CMEs and other solar eruptions can have on Earth's magnetic field and the repercussions of interaction.

**Anxiety and Fear: The Existential Crisis**  
*Honors Collegium 86: Anxiety and Fear*  

Final course paper for Honors Seminar 86: Anxiety and Fear. This was a self-chosen topic that discusses
the nature of anxiety and its relation and importance to human existence. I argue that anxiety
defines our existence, without it, we lack our connection to each other and the world.  

## First Year  

**Courage: The Capstone of Personal Growth**  
*Honors Collegium 50*     

This paper is a culmination of my quarter long research during the Honors Collegium 50 Course.
It includes my personal experience and research into the two types of courage that most
affect college students and how to implement these traits for academic and work oriented improvement.

**The Urgent Need for a Solution with the Use of GM Crops**  
*Biotechnology and Society Cluster*  

Through the first quarter of my cluster course, Biotechnology and Society, we reenacted
the 2001 Convention over the African famine where we argued over the use of GM crops as a
solution to this health crisis. My paper is my position statement as the EU Regulator and anti-GMO proponent.

**Roadmap Reflection: Subjective Truths**  
*Honors Collegium 50*  

In the Honors 50C Course, we have been reading the book Roadmap. Through reading this novel I
have begun to look at my progress and future under a different lense. This is my reflection
as to the idea of subjective truths and combinations of Foundations and Interests that I can
use to guide my future studies.
