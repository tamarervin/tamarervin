Below are outlines of my research experiences while at UCLA. Summer 2021: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory This summer I am taking my knowledge and background in Solar physics and applying it to a new field -- radial velocity detection of exoplanets. To explore activity signatures in Sun-like stars, we focus on studying variations in resolved space-based Solar images and ground-based disc-integrated spectra. Project Abstract: Stellar activity is a key roadblock towards reaching the sensitivity required to recover Earth-like exoplanetary signals using the radial velocity (RV) detection method. High resolution Dopplergrams, magnetograms, and continuum filtergrams from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) allow us to independently derive \u2018sun-as-a-star\u2019 Solar RV variations due to rotationally modulated flux imbalances and convective blueshift suppression. We present a comparison of SDO/HMI-derived RVs and observables with ground-based disc-integrated Doppler measurements from the NEID spectrograph, showing that the dominant signal in NEID RVs is due to suppression of convective blueshift. Applying our techniques to archival Solar system planetary transits, we demonstrate the ability to recover RV variations in SDO data at the 5 cm/s level. We find a strong relationship between magnetic activity indicators and RV variation, supporting efforts to examine unsigned magnetic flux as a proxy for stellar activity in slowly rotating stars. Fitting for unsigned magnetic flux allows us to improve observed scatter in NEID RV measurements by more than 50%, down to ~30 cm/s over several months. We also explore potential correlations between individual and averaged spectral line shapes, and magnetic activity indicators, motivating future studies of these observables. Academic Period 2020-2021: Predictive Science Inc./UCLA Atmospheric Sciences Department In a joint project with my advisor at Predictive Science Cooper Downs and UCLA Faculty Advisor Jacob Bortnik, I spent the school year building machine learning algorithms to detect, track, and model coronal holes and other Solar active regions. I presented my research at the American Geophysical Union's Annual Conference, AOS seminars, and UCLA Undergraduate Research Week. I was additionally awarded a UCLA Undergraduate Research Prize. We are currently in the process of publishing this project's results. Project Abstract: Modelling and tracking the evolution of magnetic activity in the Solar corona is a vital piece to improving our understanding of the near-Earth environment and for space weather prediction. In addition to temporal evolution, the Solar surface is spatially variant making it difficult to build empirical models of the Sun. Detection of magnetically active Solar Coronal regions such as Coronal Mass Ejections, Coronal Holes, and Active Regions is the next step towards building a robust and dynamic model of the Sun. We build upon previous threshold detection methods to improve our modelling of the temporal instability of Solar magnetic features. Long-term averages of EUVI/STEREO A/B (195 \u00c5) and SDO/AIA (193 \u00c5) images are used to build full-Sun maps for Coronal Hole (CH) and Active Region (AR) detection. After image processing, we detect CH/AR regions using two primary machine learning methods: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and K-means clustering. The CNN model is a supervised learning model for image segmentation while K-means is an unsupervised clustering model. These models both provide exceptional CH detections while the unsupervised method gives us the additional capability of detecting previously undetected Solar active regions. We find that the unsupervised clustering method provides the most user independent results as it mitigates the relentless problem of observation bias. March - Summer 2020: Predictive Science Inc. I started working on the Solar Physics Project at Predictive Science in March 2020 where my goals were to build an analysis pipeline to calculate data driven corrections to Solar disk images for detection and mapping purposes. This project fed into the machine learning models I built during the following school year and provided the basis for my interest in Solar Physics. I presented this updated data analysis pipeline and database structure at the American Geophysical Union's Annual Conference. We are in the publication process for this work and have published the preliminary Python package for use by the Solar physics community. Project Abstract: The detection and mapping of coronal holes in Solar EUV and X-Ray images is useful for a variety of scientific and space weather prediction applications. We discuss a community oriented python package to facilitate the creation of science quality full-sun coronal hole maps. Our package builds upon a previous pipeline for multi spacecraft synchronic mapping and detection (Caplan et al. 2016), where long-term averages of EUVI/STEREO A/B (195 \u00c5) and SDO/AIA (193 \u00c5) images are used to compute data-derived corrections for center-to-limb variations in images and intensity differences among instruments. The calculation of these corrections has been greatly simplified through modern database storage and querying techniques implemented in the image processing pipeline. After image processing, CH regions are detected using our two-threshold region-growing algorithm, which uses pixel-connectivity requirements to avoid false detections. Results are mapped on an image-by-image basis and merged to create full-Sun EUV and CH maps. The merge-mapping process favors lower intensity data in areas of overlap, and an arbitrary number of images may be used, helping to mitigate the systematics of obscuration and evolution. With this flexible new framework and data-driven approach to CH detection, we explore methods for creating time-dependent coronal hole probability maps and evaluate their use for model comparison and forecasting purposes. Summer 2019: Simons Observatory Small Aperature Telescope I worked on the Simons Observatory Small Aperature Telescope at UCSD's Cosmology Lab. This is a small aperture cryogenic telescope observed the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The CMB is the remnant radiation from the origin of the universe and can be used to confirm origin theory's. While working with this group, I primarily dealt with data analysis and monitoring of cryogenic telescope components. I designed circuitry components for collecting thermometry data and ran load tests on the cryogenic pulse tube. These results have recently been accepted for publication .","title":"Research"},{"location":"research/#research","text":"My primary research interests lie in the field of Solar physics, specifically temporally variant magnetic features and how these phenomena can be detected, tracked, and modeled for a variety of scientific uses.

I argue that through their choice of instrumentation, synthesization, and recording techniques, The Beatles enhanced the sound of \"Albatross\" and emulates the feeling of floating in the ocean to preserve the ecstasy of the era. Second Year Coronal mass ejections and their effect on the near-Earth environment Atmospheric and Oceanics Sciences C170/205A My final paper for the concurrent enrollment course AOS-C170/205A: Introduction to Solar System Plasmas. It discusses the basics behind our understanding of Coronal Mass Ejections, how they erupt, evolve through interplanetary space, and have the potential to interact with other magnetized objects. This paper concludes with a discussion of the effects CMEs and other solar eruptions can have on Earth's magnetic field and the repercussions of interaction. Anxiety and Fear: The Existential Crisis Honors Collegium 86: Anxiety and Fear Final course paper for Honors Seminar 86: Anxiety and Fear. This was a self-chosen topic that discusses the nature of anxiety and its relation and importance to human existence. I argue that anxiety defines our existence, without it, we lack our connection to each other and the world. First Year Courage: The Capstone of Personal Growth Honors Collegium 50 This paper is a culmination of my quarter long research during the Honors Collegium 50 Course. It includes my personal experience and research into the two types of courage that most affect college students and how to implement these traits for academic and work oriented improvement. The Urgent Need for a Solution with the Use of GM Crops Biotechnology and Society Cluster Through the first quarter of my cluster course, Biotechnology and Society, we reenacted the 2001 Convention over the African famine where we argued over the use of GM crops as a solution to this health crisis. My paper is my position statement as the EU Regulator and anti-GMO proponent. Roadmap Reflection: Subjective Truths Honors Collegium 50 In the Honors 50C Course, we have been reading the book Roadmap. Through reading this novel I have begun to look at my progress and future under a different lense. This is my reflection as to the idea of subjective truths and combinations of Foundations and Interests that I can use to guide my future studies.","title":"Written Work"},{"location":"write/#written-work","text":"","title":"Written Work"},{"location":"write/#third-year","text":"Machine Learning Methods for Coronal Hole and Active Region Detection Atmospheric and Oceanics Sciences 199 The detection and mapping of Coronal Holes (CH) in solar Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-Ray images is useful for a variety of scientific and space weather prediction applications.
